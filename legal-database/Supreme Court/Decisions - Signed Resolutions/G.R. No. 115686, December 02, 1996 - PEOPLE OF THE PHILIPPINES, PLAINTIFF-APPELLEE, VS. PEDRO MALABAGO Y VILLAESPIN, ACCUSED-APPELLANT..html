Malabago, his lawfully wedded wife, hitting the latter on her face and neck, which caused the victim’s instantaneous death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of the victim, in the amount of P30,000.00 as death indemnity, and also moral and exemplary damages in the amounts to be established during the trial."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>The following facts were established by the prosecution:&#160; On January 5, 1994, at about 7:00 in the evening, Guillerma Romano, appellant’s mother-in-law, was tending her sari-sari store in Barangay Gulayon, Dipolog City.&#160; The Store and its premises were lit by a kerosene lamp and the fluorescent light from the adjoining house of Dodong Opulentisima.&#160; Guillerma’s daugther. Letecia Romano Malabago, arrived and sat on one of the benches outside the store.&#160; She had just come from selling some jackfruit.&#160; Allandel, Letecia’s fourteen-year old son, appeared and sat on the bench facing her.&#160; He listened to his mother and grandmother who were conversing.&#160; A few minutes later, accused-appellant came and interrupted his wife and mother-in-law’s conversation.&#160; He and Letecia began arguing.&#160; Guillerma turned away but heard the couple’s altercation over money and appellant’s jealousy of someone.&#160; Suddenly, Guillerma heard a loud sound and she thought that appellant slapped Letecia on the face.&#160; Letecia cried out "Agay!"&#160; Looking out the store window, Guillerma saw Letecia’s face bloodied with a slash along her right ear.&#160; Appellant was facing Letecia, and with a bolo in his hand, struck her again, this time hitting the lower left side of her face, from the lips down to the neck.&#160; Letecia fell to the ground.&#160; Guillerma rushed towards her daughter and shouted for help.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> She was lifeless.<br><br>Appellant fled to Dodong Opulentisima’s house.&#160; Dodong Opulentisima later called the police.&#160; They came, fetched appellant and brought him to their station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On investigation, the police found a bloodied bolo in the pineapple plantation near appellant’s house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Letecia was found to have died of "cardio-respiratory arrest; shock hemorrhage, massive; hack wounds, multiple."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant pled not guilty to the crime.&#160; He claimed that on January 5, 1994, he was in the poblacion of Dipolog City.&#160; He alleged he did not know who hacked his wife and had no means of finding the culprit because he was placed in jail after her killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> He claimed through his son, Allandel, as defense witness, that Guillerma testified against him because she was against their marriage.&#160; He was then jobless.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <b>The proccedings show that Guillerma, together with her husband, catalino, and appellant’s and Letecia’s three children namely, Allandel, Aljun and Alex later signed as affidavit of desistance and moved to dismiss the case against him.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The trial court upheld the prosecution and on May 10, 1994 convicted accused-appellant of <b>parricide</b> and sentenced him to <b>death</b> pursuant to republic Act No. 7659.<br><br>Before us appellant assigns the following errors:<br><blockquote><center>"I</center><br>The sentence of death imposed by the trial court on the appellant is an unconstitutional penalty for being violative of fundamental human rights and is, thus, null and void.<br><br><center>II</center><br>The judgment of conviction is null and void for having been rendered by a trial court ousted of jurisdiction because of the grave violations of the appellant’s rights to due process committed by no less that the presiding judge himself as shown by his conduct at trial.<br><br><center>III</center><br>Assuming without conceding that the trial court was not ousted of jurisdiction, it nevertheless gravely erred in convicting the appellant of parricide considering that the prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt as demonstrated by:<br><br>(a)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The essential elements of the crime of parricide like appellants’s&#160; marriage to Letecia, the cause of Letecia’s death and appellant’s participation therein were facts already established by the prosecution in its evidence in chief.&#160; Using his discretion, the trial judge questioned the witnesses to clear up obscurities in their testimonies ans sworn statements.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> The wise use of such discretion cannot be assailed as a specie of bias.<br><br>A judge is called upon to ascertain the truth of the controversy before him.&#160;

If to the mind of the parties, the trial judge was unduly interfering in their presentation of evidence, they were free to manifest their objection.&#160; They were likewise free to ask redirect questions from their witness after interrogation by the trial court.&#160; In the instant case, however, they never manifested that the questions of the trial judge had traversed the allowable parameters.&#160; Even assuming that some of the questions were incriminating, we cannot hold that the witnesses were compelled to incriminate themselves.&#160; The records show they answered the questions of the court freely and voluntarily and without any objection from their respective counsels.<br><br>The prosecution evidence is based solely on the testimony of Guillerma Romano.&#160; Nonetheless, her testimony is clear, spontaneous and straightforward.&#160; Her inconsistencies are minor and inconsequential and they are not incongruous with her credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Her testimony was not eroded even when she was presented by the defense as a hostile witness.&#160; <b>She admittedly signed the affidavit of desistance for the sake of her three grandchildren and this is understandable in light of the circumstances of the case.</b>&#160; Allandel and his brothers pled that she withdraw the complaint because they did not want their father to be in prison.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Deep in her heart, however, Guillerma wanted justice for her daughter and thus, she testified for the prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The fact that she objected to her daughter’s marriage to appellant is too flimsy a reason to impel her to testify against the father of her grandchildren.<br><br>We agree with the trial court that appellant’s defense of <b>alibi</b> is weak and unconvincing.&#160; Appellant was positively identified as the one who hacked his wife to death.&#160; Moreover, it was not physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime on that fateful evening.&#160; The poblacion of Dipolog City is merely four kilometers from Barangay Gulayon and this distance may be traversed within a few minutes by motorized vehicle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><b>Be that as it may, we find that the trial court erred in appreciating the aggravating circumstance of treachery.</b>&#160; For treachery to be present, two conditions must concur: (a) the employment of means of execution which would ensure the safety of the offender from defensive and rataliatory acts of the victim, giving the victim no opportunity to defend himself; and (b) the means, method and manner of execution were deliberately and consciously adopted by the offender.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> It is true that appellant hacked his wife who was then unarmed and had no opportunity to defend herself.&#160; However, the evidence does not show that appellant deliberately and consciously employed this particular mode of attack to ensure the killing of the victim.&#160; The unembroidered facts reveal that appellant hacked his wife in the midst of a sudden, unscripted heated argument.&#160; This precludes the idea that appellant priorly planned to kill his wife.&#160; Indeed, appellant was not carrying his bolo at that time.&#160; The bolo was hanging in its usual place on one of the posts of the sari-sari store.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Treachery, to be appreciated, must spark an attack that is deliberate, sudden and unexpected not where it is prefaced by an unforeseen heated argument with the victim standing face to face with her assailant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The trial court also erred in disregarding the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.&#160;

There was, in my view, treachery employed by the accused-appellant in killing his wife because the latter, even in the course of her arguments with accused-appellant (her husband), did not expect the latter to suddenly and unexpectedly hack her. She had no opportunity to defend herself from so sudden and precipitate an attack. In People v. Lualhati,1 the Court stated thus:<br><br>"There was no sufficient provocation on the part of the victim which would have placed him on guard and prepared him for accused-appellant’s assault. In People v. Cruz (213 SCRA 611) we held that there was treachery if the commission of the crime was sudden and unexpected even if the armed attack was made face to face. Thus, under the circumstances, the victim was clearly not in any position to defend himself to the unreasonable and unexpected attack of the accused-appellant."<br><br>There was also, in my view, no voluntary surrender on the part of accused-appellant as to entitle him to the mitigating circumstance on this score. He did not voluntarily surrender. He was fetched by the police authorities in the house of Dodong Opulentisima. In People v. Flores,2 the Court stated:<br><br>"Neither can we accept accused-appellant’s plea of voluntary surrender. He did not surrender to the police. In fact, the evidence adduced shows that it was the police authorities who came to the factory looking for him. It was there that accused-appellant was pointed to them. Seeing that the police was already approaching him, accused-appellant did not offer any resistance and peacefully went with them. With the police closing in, accused-appellant actually had no choice but to go with them. To be sure, no surrender was made by accused-appellant."<br><br>By this senseless and brutal killing of his wife, the mother of his three (3) children, accused-appellant, in my opinion, has lost the right to live. Society will be far better off without him around. While compassion is, in itself, a virtue, it cannot and should not replace justice under law, in this particular case, justice to the victim and her three (3) orphaned children.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.
